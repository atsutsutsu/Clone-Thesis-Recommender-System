            text: 'An interest assessment can help you learn which careers might be the best fit for you. It is meant to help you find careers that you might enjoy. It will give you a broad list of career options that match your interests. Skills assessments can also match your skills to careers. Holland codes help you match what you like to do with appropriate careers. To figure out which careers will suit you, you first must understand your own interest profile. You can do so by taking a Holland Code assessment. Then, once you have your scores in each of the six interest areas, you can do a search to find careers that match your top interests.',

            title: 'Holland Interest Assessment',
            text: "This interest assessment is based on Holland's Inventory of Basic Interests, also sometimes called the RIASEC assessment. It shows that people with similar personal interests often like the same types of careers. Each of the 6 interest areas describes a broad field of similar work tasks and activities. Interest areas are also descriptive of people: their values, motivations, and preferences. For each interest area, there is a collection of typical job tasks, as well as a description of the type of person who would be interested in doing those sorts of tasks.",
